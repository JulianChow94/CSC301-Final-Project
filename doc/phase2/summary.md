**Phase 1 Summary**

**Idea:**

Food pairing or meal suggestions. Program will suggest foods that pair well together with emphasis on nutritional value as well as taste. Will factor in user preferences and dietary restrictions. 

**Target Audience:**

People who are conscious of health implications of the food they eat, but also desire food that tastes good when combined. Users with dietary restrictions as well as variances in cooking ability will be accommodated. Finally, users that are time or budget sensitive will be able to make the program take that into account when presenting results.

**Key Personas:**

* Sarah - a 29 year-old woman that recently started a vegan diet. Some of Sarahâ€™s concerns are eating the same dishes and having to look up nutritional values all the time.

* Mike - a 18 year-old college freshman whose main concerns are time spent preparing meals and finding recipes to cook based on ingredients that he has.

**Key Scenarios:**

* Sarah needs to find vegan substitutes of meat that will give her the nutritional benefits she would otherwise get. She can navigate to the program and type in the name of one of her favourite dishes. Then, ask the program to find substitutes based on the lost nutritional value that also have the "Vegan" tag.The program will come up with a variety of alternative solutions for Sarah.

* Mike can use the program to find a meal to cook that does not require a lot of time both in preparation and getting any ingredients he lacks.

**Feature List and Design Principles:**

* some sort of input for user variables mentioned above (time, budget, dietary restrictions, etc)

* food and meal list should show its nutritional content, time to prepare, monetary cost, and other factors that may impact user decisions

* a thesaurus of sorts for food (ie. put in a type of food you want to eat, returns results that are similar but might be better depending on user variables)

* general search feature

* surprise me button (randomly get food or meal that falls within a certain degree of freedom of user preferences)

* should be cross platform and allow use regardless of user device (not sure if technically feasible within context of course?)
