<h2>Process (Phase 2)</h2>

**Process**

The team was organized based on interests. For example people who were interested in UI/UX design were put on that task. Tools used included Slack and Skype, to maintain communication, and Google Docs for collaboration. 

We met in person for our initial meetings but due to scheduling conflicts across all 7 members, we switched over to skype for our meetings. Using skype, we hold meetings twice every weekend and the meeting usually lasts around 2 hours. 

Priority of user stories were determined based on how important they were to the core functionality of our product. For example, stories which involved recommendations of healthy and tasty meals were ranked higher than other stories because it reflected the main focus of our application. 

Difficulty of user stories were based on an estimated number of man-hours required to implement. Currently the difficulty for most stories is set at a 4/5 , because we anticipate that some sort of AI might need to be implemented to output recommendations.   

**Lessons Learned:**

Don’t start work until we know what we are doing going forward
Stay on course during meetings. Define an agenda beforehand and distribute to teammates.
Think outside of the box (i.e don’t do schedulers).
Give daily progress reports during meetings
