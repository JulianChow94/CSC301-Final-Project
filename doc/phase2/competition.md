##Competition

**Competitor #1: MyFitnessPal**
MyFitnessPal offers a very similar service that our prospective product offers in the sense that it generates reccomendations of healthy food choices for the user.

MyFitnessPal is targetting users with the main goal of **weight loss** and it chooses foods via tracking of the user's diets to determine how much nutrients and calories they need for their goals. In contrast, our product's main concern is to be an aid to the user's lifestyle, it asks the user what he/she wants to eat and recommends something healthy but similar to the user's input.

In summary, MyFitnessPal targets users that want to lose weight and provides them a plan to do so. A probable reason of why MyFitnessPal did not include our feature of food reccomendation based on what the user wants it due to the simple fact that they want their users to reach the weight goal as efficently as possible. *If their users were able to somewhat control what kind of things they want to eat, it is probably that it would take much longer for them to reach their weight goal, thus taking credibility away from their service*.


**Competitor #2: Gojee**
Gojee tackles the same problem as our product; answering the simple question: "What should I make/eat for lunch/dinner?". The recommendation is done by asking the users what **ingredients** that they have on hand and also what type of foods they don't like.

Essentially Gojee and our prespective product are targeting the same users (users that want to know what they should make for a meal). However, our product distinguishes itself from Gojee by recommending meals with dishes that **complement** each other in terms of taste and considers the nutritional benefits of them.

Perhaps Gojee decided not to provide nutrition and dish matching services because it wants its users to be able to make their meal quickly by reccomending foods that the user has readily available and not recommend meals that may require users to go out on a shopping spree.

**Competitor #3: Ness**
Ness is an iOS app that also tries to help users decide what they should eat by building a "taste profile" of the user over time.

Ness uses the same principle as our product of helping users who don't know what they should eat. Similarly to our product, Ness's reccomendations are based on what the user likes (their taste and preference) by building a **taste profile** of the user*, however Ness is strictly limited to restaurants while our product is intended to focus only on home cooked meals and our product offers a feature that lets users **try something new*** via our "Surprise Me" function.
