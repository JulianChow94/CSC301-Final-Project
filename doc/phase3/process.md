### Process.md

For this phase, we used a Project visualization System (Trello) to organize the workflow of our project. In Trello, we deployed a bulletin board, and used cards to manage our project in a Kanban style. During Phase 2, we found it very difficult to arrange times that everyone was available to meet for discussion. This lead to many people being left out of the loop as far as what had been accomplished in the project so far. We used Trello as a way to fix this problem as we went forward with our project. Using Trello made it so that each person could post new issues they found with the project as well as what they were working on at the time so that there was no confusion as to what had to be done. This allowed us to work on different parts of the project without everyone having to meet up to discuss it in person. 

In addition to Trello, we used Slack and Skype to maintain communication and git for version control. We opted out of using automated build and testing tools, because we believed our project was small enough to do without it. Instead, for backend code testing, we encouraged teammates to write unit tests using the python unittest module, and run them before making pull requests to the handout.

Rather than take meeting minutes, we discussed what needed to be done and what we had accomplished, and then created/edited/flagged as complete github issues plus Trello tasks during the meeting. Through this group members were fully updated on tasks that needed to be completed and tasks that were completed, as well as creating the appropriate documentation to brief group members who could not make the meeting.
