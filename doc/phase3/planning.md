### Planning.md

**Initial Plan**

From phase 2, we were able to build a very simple ingredient and meal recommendation system, that only returned results that were filtered by a set of tags. Though the system took two inputs (ingredient or meal, and a set of tags represented by dietary restrictions), the only input that had impact on results was the dietary restrictions. Therefore for phase 3, it was our goal to expand on the functionality of our recommendation system, with the minimal goal being that the results returned being dependent on both user inputs. 

In particular, our goal was to implement features which satisfy the rest of our user stories. These features include:

* Providing random meal recommendations

* A rating system to help users determine which meals are tasty

* Being able to sort meal recommendations based on number of ingredients used

**Adjustments**

Our initial plan involved using a single-web page design using angularjs to power the front-end. However two weeks in, due to the lack of web programming experience within the group and the difficulty of learning the framework, it was decided to go with a multi-web page design. Though this results in a less attractive UI and UX, it was decided that being able to complete the sprint backlog had a higher priority.

**Retrospective**

In this phase, we did not specify clearly enough how our web application was supposed to behave, this caused us to make some last minute changes to our models. For example, we made a last minute decision to separate the entities of a "meal" and “ingredients”. However, one thing that did** **go according to plan was our distribution of work. We were able to accurately predict the workload of each task and distribute the workload among the team more evenly, this afforded us ample room to be able to help each other when teammates got stuck on a task.
